Instruction on how to run the application:
I added spring security dependency, so after executing the program, you have to enter a username: web and password: sparrow but you enter the URL first to be able to login;
and then the URL to get all the customers is http://localhost:8088/customer and to get customers by id is http://localhost:8088/customers/100 
to get all transaction is http://localhost:8088/transactions
I also include the sql data in resource folder.
I used MySql as database.
Don't forget to update the database username and password with your own database information in application.properties
